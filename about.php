            i am currently available for freelance art, design, & character work (for commercial projects, or personal 
            projects that wouldn't just be a "normal" personal commission). 
            you can contact me at 
            <a href="mailto:van@supercomp.net">van@supercomp.net</a>.<br>
            i do sporadic commission openings on twitter and discord; if i have not posted about an opening, then my commissions are closed.
